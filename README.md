# ufo Javascript Challenge

# Overview
The goal of this challenge was to provide a more in-depth analysos of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria. We want our table to be more dynamic and useful when filtering data for the users. 

# Results
As you can see in the image below it is fairly straightforward on how to enter data into the search table.

# Summary
*The biggest drawback with this search filter is that there isn't a button to click once the data you want to retrieve is entered
*In order to initiate your search, you must enter in what you are searching for and then hit enter
*It is not very intuitive and I highly doubt most users would know that you need to do that.
